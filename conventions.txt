Rules that ya'll need to follow when working on this project to preserve our sanity!

------- RULE NUMBER ONE: 
    Keep all your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself):
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself

    "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system"   

------- RULE NUMBER TWO:
    Do not clusterfuck all yor code into one file. Keep it into separate files.
    "start.css" will dictate how the start page should look like. "main.css" will 
    dictate how the main page would look like. 

------- RULE NUMBER THREE:
    Always, ALWAYS state what feature what you're going to work on in the BaseCamp before working on it

    This will reduce the amount of Git Merge errors we get and it's also better for teamwork and collaboration.

------- RULE NUMBER FOUR:
    ALWAYS PUT FOUR SPACES INSTEAD OF TABS!!! This will make it look better
    on GitHub
